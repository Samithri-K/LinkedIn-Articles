I never thought moving from a QA Lead role offshore to leading UAT onsite would teach me so much, about communication, empathy, and most of all, myself. When I first stepped into this new role, I expected familiar challenges: test planning, issue tracking, stakeholder coordination. But what I found was something different. The conversations were more personal. The feedback was instant. The business users weren’t just names in JIRA anymore they were sitting right across the table, asking real questions about how the product would support their day-to-day work.

These past few months have been filled with learning, sometimes uncomfortable, often eye-opening, but always valuable. And I’m still learning.

This article is a reflection of that journey, what surprised me, what I’m still learning, and how this shift changed the way I see quality, collaboration, and leadership.

The Shift: From Systems to People
As an offshore QA Lead, my focus was often technical, creating robust test strategies, coordinating test cycles, reviewing automation scripts, tracking defects in JIRA and making sure the product functioned as expected. Most of my communication with clients and stakeholders was through scheduled calls, emails, or via JIRA comments. Things were structured.

But as a UAT Lead onsite, the lens changed completely. It was no longer just about functional accuracy. It became about user experience, business confidence, and real-life impact. I had to step into the shoes of end users, speak their language, and help bridge the gap between tech teams and business goals.

What Changed (and What I’m Still Getting Used To)
1. Real-time collaboration : Instead of working behind the scenes, I am now in the room, live, face-to-face with stakeholders. Feedback came immediately, often emotionally. I had to learn to stay calm, listen fully, and respond clearly. It’s still a work in progress.

2. Navigating new cultures and expectations : Relocating and working onsite introduced me to a different work culture, more conversational, often less formal. I’ve learned (sometimes the hard way) that soft skills are just as critical as technical ones.

3. Business users take the lead : In QA, I was used to leading the testing effort. In UAT, my role is to guide and empower the business to test what matters to them. That shift in ownership was new, and I’m still learning how to facilitate without taking over.

4. Letting go of control : UAT can be unpredictable. Priorities shift, users test out of sequence, and not everything goes to plan. I’ve learned to adapt quickly, and to focus on progress rather than perfection.

What’s Helping Me Through It
Curiosity and humility : I don’t have all the answers, and that’s okay. I ask questions, take feedback, and keep learning.
Strong relationships : Building trust with business users and delivery teams has been key. A good conversation often solves more than a perfect plan.
Celebrating small wins : Whether it’s a successful session with SME's or a defect caught early, or just the end users explaining the system work as they expected, these moments keep me going.

Still Learning, Still Growing
This journey from offshore QA to onsite UAT hasn’t been a straight line, it’s been full of learning curves, mindset shifts, and growth. And it’s only been a few months; I still have a long way to go. I’m sharing this journey in the hope that, one day, it helps someone who’s stepping into the unknown—just like I did.

If you’re on a similar path or thinking about making a transition, just know: it’s okay to not have it all figured out. Stay open, keep showing up, and give yourself permission to grow.
